Py City School Analysis Summary Report

District summary table reveals that the overall passing score for total schools under the district is just 65.17%. It is a bit lower passing percentage considering the district has a total of $24,649,428.00 budget. It would be better if we can see the budget details such as where the budget is going and if it is going to student tutoring center/student academic development to draw a proper conclusion. 

Top and bottom performing schools table reveals that school type makes a difference when it comes to high performing school vs low performing school. All top 5 high performing schools are charter school type, and all bottom 5 lower performing schools are district type. We will also have to take a consideration of how the charter school type has a lower total student count compared to the district school type. It is interesting to note that school budget does not have any correlation with passing score performance. Although bottom performer schools have higher budget, they are still at the bottom. The score by school type table provides a better overall summary since charter school type has average passing score of 90% vs the district school type has average passing score of just 53.67%. 
 
Spending ranges table reveals that the lesser the students spend, the higher their grades are. Students with less than $585 spending ranges have over 90% overall passing score whereas students with spending ranges between $645 and $680 have significantly lower passing score of 53.52%.
